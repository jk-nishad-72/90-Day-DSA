—Q 103. Book Allocation Problems 

Given an array **arr[]** of integers, where each element **arr[i]** represents the number of pages in the i-th book. You also have an integer **k** representing the number of students. The task is to allocate books to each student such that:

- Each student receives atleast one book.
- Each student is assigned a contiguous sequence of books.
- No book is assigned to more than one student.

The objective is to **minimize the maximum number of pages** assigned to any student. In other words, out of all possible allocations, find the arrangement where the student who receives the most pages still has the **smallest possible maximum**.

**Note:** If it is not possible to allocate books to all students, return **-1**.
