—Q 77.GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)  
                OR 
     .HCF(Highest common Factor)

—Q 78.1979.Find the greatest Common divisor

3 Way to solve it =>

1. )Using For loop  TC(O(min(a,b))
2. )Euclidean Method ➖ TC(O(max(a,b))
       a) With While loop 
       b) with Recursion 
1. ) Using Algorithm TC (O(logn))
